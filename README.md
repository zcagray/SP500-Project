# SP500-Project

This project was inspired by my desire to analyze a dataset using Python and my endless curiosity towards investing.

I decided to take a look at the S&P 500's daily closing price over the past 10 years.

I also analyzed select individual stocks within the S&P 500 to determine how they were impacted by the pandemic and assess their level of volatility. 

The aim is to use basic statistical analysis and data visualization to support my (un)wise decision to allocate 80% of my portfolio to *VOO*, an exchange-traded fund (ETF).

Note: The data was gathered [here](https://fred.stlouisfed.org) using a FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) API.
